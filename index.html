<h4>Land pollution:</h4>
<p>The Earth we live on is polluted by our daily garbage which makes the land on this planet bad for the animals around us. Americans alone created around 258 tons of waste. Organic material is the largest component in the garbage collected. Industrial waste also pollutes the Earth and is a significant part of the waste created. Industries use 4 million pounds of materials to meet the needs of the average American family.</p>
<h4>Water Pollution:</h4>
<p>When our oceans are polluted it affects the animals and the ecosystems in the oceans. Water pollution happens when harmful things mix in with the water. Due to water pollution in some areas you canâ€™t go swimming or fishing. Many people do not have access to clean water due to the water pollution. </p>
